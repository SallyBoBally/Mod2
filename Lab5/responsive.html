                If you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of milk. When you give him the milk, he'll probably ask you for a straw. When he's finished, he'll ask for a napkin. Then he will want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn't have a milk mustache.

                    <li>When he looks into the mirror, he might notice his hair needs a trim. So he will probably ask for a pair of nails scissors.</li>
                    <li>When he's finished giving himself a trim, he'll want a broom to sweep up. He'll start sweeping. He might get carried away and sweep every room in the house. He may even end up washing the floors as well.</li>
                    <li>When he's done, he'll probably want to take a nap. You wil have to fix a little box for him with a blanket and a pillow. He'll crawl in, make himself comfortable and fluff the pillow a few times.</li>

                    <li>He'll probably ask you to read him a story. So you'll read him one from one for your books, and he'll ask to see the pictures. When he looks at the pictures, he'll get sos excited he'll want to odraw one of his own. He'll ask for paper and crayons.</li>
                    <li>He'll draw a picture. When the picture is finished, he'll want to sign his sname with a pen. Then he'll want to hang his picture on your refrigerator. Which means he will need.. scotch tape.</li>

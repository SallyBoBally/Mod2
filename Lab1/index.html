        Charlie brown was raking leaves. Lucy was holding a football.
        And Linus was inspecting the pumpkin patch. it can only mean one thing.
        Halloween was almost here. Back inside, Linus started writing his yearly letter to the great pumpkin.
        Dear Great Pumpkin im looking forward to your arrival on Halloween night.
        I hope you bring me lots of presents.
        Who are you writing to Linus asked Charlie Brown.
        The Great Pumpkin! Linus replied
        On Halloween night, the Great Pumpkin rises out of his pumpkin patch
        and flies through the air with his bag of toys for all the children
        you must be crazy Charlie Brown said.
